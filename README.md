# futurefetch

## Introduction
Spiritual Successor to **neofetch** *by dylanaraps*  for GNU/Linux *(and possibly other Unix/Unix-like systems)*

futurefetch is a tool to display useful system information in a visually appealing way. *(yeah that is pretty much it :D)*

## The Idea
So basically with neofetch, OS developers had to go to the neofetch repo to request support for their operating system or fork neofetch and make their own custom version to host on their repos. Futurefetch basically aims to completely change that, and instead of us having to add support for millions upon millions of Operating Systems on our tool, developers can just customize one file in their OS's `etc` directory and ship the futurefetch tool with their product. 

## Installation
To avoid having to create packages for all the formats out there, each release will have a downloadable script (`installffetch.sh`) that will work on GNU/Linux *(and possibly other *nix systems)*
